    <string name="bio">Hi. Welcome to my App! \n My name is Zack and I love to learn new
                        technologies. \n Right now I am learning Android and the Kotlin programming
                        language. \n
                        I will be learning this language for at-least the next six weeks. Hopefully,
                        though I will be getting a new job and earning my degree and then my masters.

                        I have worked with Swift, some Java and I have touched on Javascript and Node.js.
                        Although, I prefer mobile and backend development over web and front end.
                        I will always pick mobile and backend dev over anything else.\n

                        I have worked with docker and containers. I use Jira and I work in Scrum and\n
                        with agile methodologies. I would like to continue my learning, and learn more about
                        algorithms and how we can use them to influence the world in a better way.
